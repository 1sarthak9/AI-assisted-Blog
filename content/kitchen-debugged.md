Welcome to **Kitchen Debugged**—the spin-off I didn’t know I needed. This isn’t about gourmet food or perfect plating. This is about me, a self-proclaimed logical thinker, entering the kitchen with misplaced confidence and walking out... well, eventually walking out.

## The Curious Beginning

It all started with one dangerous thought: *How hard can cooking be?*

I mean, I’ve handled pointers in C, built websites from scratch, and debugged hours of broken code. Compared to that, making dinner sounded like a piece of cake—spoiler alert, there was no cake. There was only smoke, a few regrets, and a moment where I genuinely questioned if I had enemies hiding inside my spice rack.

## Day One: The Onion Incident

First dish? Something simple. Fry some onions, make a curry base. Easy.

Except no one told me onions don’t wait for your motivation to catch up. One second, they’re raw. Blink once, and they’re burnt with a vengeance. I had no idea something could go from "not yet" to "too late" that fast. It felt personal.

Also—why do onions attack your eyes like you owe them money?

## The Pasta That Gave Up

Next up: pasta. I thought I nailed it. Boil water, throw in pasta, drain, add sauce. Sounds straightforward, right?

Wrong.

I forgot to salt the water. I left it boiling like it was trying to evaporate into another universe. By the time I remembered the sauce, the pasta had turned into mushy despair. I tried to act like it was intentional—“this is how they serve it in Italy,” I told myself.

They absolutely do not.

## Spices, or Chaos in Tiny Jars

Then came the spices. So many names. Some of them smelled like a good decision. Others smelled like a potential lawsuit.

I made the classic mistake of adding *everything*, thinking more meant better. At some point, the dish tasted like it couldn’t decide if it was sweet, sour, or just deeply confused.

## A Developer’s Breakdown

At this point, I had flashbacks of trying to fix a bug at 2 a.m. on zero sleep. The same pattern was emerging—too many assumptions, not enough reading. Cooking, it turns out, is not just vibes. It needs attention. Timing. Preparation.

Much like writing clean code, it demands structure. No freestyle fixes. No “let’s just wing it” moments. Every shortcut showed up on the plate—and not in a good way.

## Turning the Tables

But here’s the thing. I didn’t give up.

I started *reading* recipes like documentation. Measured things out. Got my ingredients ready *before* turning on the stove. Tasted as I went. And slowly, things improved.

One day, the dal wasn’t burnt. The pasta had texture. The toast wasn’t just a memory of bread. I wasn’t a chef, but I was surviving.

## What I Took Away

- **Confidence is good. Overconfidence is... well, burnt.**
- **The kitchen doesn’t care about your GitHub profile.**
- **Every mistake leaves a mark—sometimes on your plate, sometimes on your soul.**
- **But each fail makes the next attempt a little smarter.**

## Final Thoughts

Cooking taught me what debugging never could: patience when you can’t Ctrl+Z, humility when your food says “nope,” and the quiet pride of getting something *almost* right with your own hands.

It’s not perfect. Neither is life. But there’s joy in the mess, laughter in the learning, and stories in every failed recipe.

So here’s to burnt beginnings, edible ends, and every delicious disaster in between.

**Bon appé-debug.**
