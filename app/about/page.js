                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-50">
                  Sarthak’s coding journey began in high school when he stumbled upon his first programming language—C++. What started as a simple curiosity quickly turned into a passion, as I spent countless hours experimenting with code, building small projects, and learning the fundamentals of software development.

                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-50">
                  After mastering the basics,  thirst for knowledge grew mainly in college. I began exploring more complex topics such as data structures, algorithms, and web development. Enrolling in online courses and attending coding bootcamps, Harry quickly expanded his skill set, taking on freelance projects to apply his knowledge in real-world scenarios.
